# **Description Of Project**
## Calculate and keep track of Salaries and Morgages.
### `A mortgage company is a firm engaged in the business of originating and/or funding mortgages for residential or commercial property. A mortgage company is often just the originator of a loan; it markets itself to potential borrowers and seeks funding from one of several client financial institutions that provide the capital for the mortgage itself.` ###

## **Setup/Installation Requirements**

 
    1. Approval
    This is the initial stage where you get to know if you qualify for a mortgage and how much you can qualify for. The companies and banks look at your employment and your income details i.e salaries in order to determine how much of a loan they can offer to you.

    2.Processing
    After the mortgage loan has been approved processing then commences and here one is required to provide the bank with some of the required documentation and details.

    3.Offer
    After qualification then one is issued with a letter of offer and this letter will stipulate the terms and conditions of the mortgage and one is required to accept the offer terms provided provided by the financial institution.
    
    4.Payments
    The lender then gets the money and either fowards it to the person involved with the agreement signed. It is a process that takes around 90 - 180 days.
